# Track downloader

## Objective

Simple program that uses Deezer API and selenium scrapping to search and download songs from Youtube.

## How to use it

There are two options top-songs-dowloader.py and the multiprocessing option. Multiprocessing can be a little bit faster, but might miss some songs due to the loading delay of the page. Both options can either download a number of the top songs from a certain artist, according to the Deezer API, or a single song title from an artist.

This project is only for research and learning.
